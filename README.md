GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax to define the workflow. Each workflow is stored as a separate YAML file in your code repository, in a directory named .github/workflows.

You can create an example workflow in your repository that automatically triggers a series of commands whenever code is pushed. In this workflow, GitHub Actions checks out the pushed code, installs the bats testing framework, and runs a basic command to output the bats version: bats -v.

In your repository, create the .github/workflows/ directory to store your workflow files.

In the .github/workflows/ directory, create a new file called learn-github-actions.yml and add the following code.
